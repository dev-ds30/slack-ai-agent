# slack-ai-agent
Slack AI agent for notifications

End‑to‑end ambient AI that “listens” to Slack channels, builds memory graph on conversations, and autonomously suggests action items.

Utilizes LangChain for agent orchestration, RedisGraph for memory storage, and a custom planner for multi‑step reasoning.
